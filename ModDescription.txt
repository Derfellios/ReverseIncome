This mod adds one new rule: If you are in a team with two active players, their incomes are swapped!

If the game is a 1v1 without teams enabled, income will be swapped as well.

Due to technical difficulties, this change does not apply to turn 1. 

The mod is compatible with Sanction Cards. Play the card on the player holding the income to reduce that income. 

For obvious reasons, the mod does not support local deployments. If you enable it, the mod will be ignored.
